//🔍 Why Use AJAX and SignalR Together?
//1️⃣ AJAX Updates Local UI Immediately
//When a user performs an action (e.g., adding/removing a cart item), we:

//Use AJAX to send a request to the server.
//Get a response (e.g., updated cart data) and update the UI instantly.
//👉 This makes the UI feel fast and responsive without waiting for SignalR.

//2️⃣ SignalR Synchronizes Across Multiple Clients
//If the same user has multiple devices/tabs open, AJAX alone won’t update the other tabs.

//SignalR notifies all active sessions when a cart update happens.
//Other open tabs receive the notification and reload the cart.
//👉 This ensures real-time synchronization across all connected clients.

//🛠 How They Work Together
//1. User Adds Item to Cart
//🔹 AJAX immediately updates the local UI.
//🔹 The server updates the database and triggers a SignalR notification.
//🔹 Other connected clients receive the update and reload their cart.

//2. User Removes Item from Cart
//🔹 AJAX removes the item from the local UI.
//🔹 The server processes the removal and notifies all other connected clients via SignalR.
//🔹 Other open tabs get the update and refresh automatically.

//🔄 What Happens If We Only Use AJAX?
//❌ Other open tabs/devices won’t get the update.
//❌ The cart will be out of sync across multiple sessions.

//🔄 What Happens If We Only Use SignalR?
//❌ The cart update only appears when the server sends a notification.
//❌ The local UI would feel slower, since we wait for a server event.

//✅ Conclusion
//🚀 AJAX gives an instant response for the user.
//🚀 SignalR ensures all tabs/devices stay in sync.

//💡 Best Practice:

//Use AJAX for immediate feedback.
//Use SignalR to notify other devices/tabs.
